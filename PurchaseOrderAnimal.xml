<AboutCondition>  
<Title>About the Condition</Title>
<Text>Achromatopsia, also called as day blindness or color blindness, is characterized by cone photoreceptor
dysfunction of the eye, leading to severely reduced or complete vision loss during day light hours. Dogs
show signs of avoiding bright light or distress in bright light (photophobia), nystagamus (uncontrolled eye
movements) and sometimes total colour-blindness. CNGB3 gene associated Achromatopsia is a rare genetic
condition with complete loss of cone photoreceptor function while rod photoreceptors remain intact.
Cataract development may also occur frequently in affected dogs.</Text>
</AboutCondition>


<OnsetandPrognosis>  
<Title>Onset and Prognosis</Title>
<Text>Symptoms appear early between 8-12 weeks of age when owner observes pup’s difficulty in negotiating
obstacles. Initially cones start developing but once non-functional, their inner and outer segments gradually
deteriorate, followed by a slow loss of cones throughout the dog’s lifetime. Cone function loss is confirmed
by electroretinography.</Text>

with Achromatopsia-2.</Text>
</GeneticsandInheritance>  



  
<Management>  
<Title>Management</Title>
<Text>

1. Although currently, there is no cure, clinical trials in the area of gene therapy are showing encouraging
results for treating CNGA3 associated Achromatopsia-2.
2. Avoid additional damage to retina by walking the dog in shady regions, avoiding bright and direct sunlight.
3. Regular ophthalmic check-ups, electroretinography as directed by Veterinarian
4. Avoid using affected dogs and unaffected carrier parents in breeding programs

</CarrierRedHighilghtedText>
  
<AboutCondition>  
<Title>About the Condition</Title>
<Text>Amelogenesis Imperfecta refers to an inherited group of Carriers affecting the structure, composition, and
quantity of tooth enamel. It is a common non-syndromic genetic Carrier caused by malfunction of
enamel proteins, and results in enamel hypoplasia (thinning or absence of enamel), small and pointed
teeth, rough surface with brown color, and greater gaps between teeth. The symptoms are noticeable in
young dogs and become more apparent with age due to premature enamel damage.</Text>
</AboutCondition>


<OnsetandPrognosis>  
<Title>Onset and Prognosis</Title>
<Text>Amelogenesis imperfecta affects pups as early as 2-12 weeks. Both deciduous and permanent teeth are
affected and gap between teeth increases as the dog grows older.</Text>
</OnsetandPrognosis>


<Breeds>  
<Title>Dog Breeds</Title>
<Text>The breeds commonly affected include Standard poodle dogs, Italian Greyhound, Parson Rusell Terrier,
Akita, Alaskan Malamute, Chow Chow, German shepherd and Spitz-type. The prevalence of enamel
hypoplasia in Italian Greyhounds is as high as 14%. In Parson Russell Terriers, carrier frequency of ENAM
mutation is 9%.</Text>
</Breeds>  
  
  
  
  
<GeneticsandInheritance>  
<Title>Genetics and Inheritance</Title>
<Text>ENAM gene provides instruction for making a protein called enamelin which is essential for normal tooth
development. The 5-bp deletion on ENAM gene leads to disruption of enamelin protein production resulting
in abnormal tooth development. It is an autosomal recessive Carrier, resulting when two copies of ENAM
gene carry the mutation, one copy inherited from each parent. Unaffected carrier parents have 25% risk of
having a pup with Amelogenesis Imperfecta.</Text>

<AboutCondition>  
<Title>About the Condition</Title>
<Text>Leucocyte adhesion deficiencies are inherited disorders of immunodeficiency due to marked leukocytosis.
Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-III (LAD-III) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by
recurrent bacterial infections. Affected animals die because of extreme susceptibility to infections, caused
by an inability of white blood cells to pass from the blood stream to the infected tissue or site. Clinical signs
include severe, recurrent bacterial skin infections, impaired wound healing, fever, gingivitis, lameness and
enlarged lymph nodes.</Text>
</AboutCondition>


<OnsetandPrognosis>  
<Title>Onset and Prognosis</Title>
<Text>The age of onset is around 10 weeks of age with average age of presentation to the veterinarian at 13.5 week
with signs of recurrent infections, fever, gingivitism, salivation, and impaired wound healing. Untreated dogs
often do not survive beyond the age of 6 months.</Text>
</OnsetandPrognosis>


<Breeds>  
<Title>Dog Breeds</Title>
<Text>This condition is seen in German shepherd and a mixed breed of German shepherd and Rottweiler mongrel.
Prevalence of the mutant allele is estimated to be approximately 5% in the US Irish Setter population, and
7.6% in the Australian Irish Setter population.</Text>
</Breeds>  
  
  
  
  
<GeneticsandInheritance>  
<Title>Genetics and Inheritance</Title>
<Text>FERMT3 is also known as KINDLIN3 gene. Mutation in the gene results in lack of a membrane glycoprotein
called kindlin-3 protein resulting in LAD-III. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, resulting when two copies
of FERMT3 gene carry the mutation, one copy inherited from each parent. Unaffected carrier parents have
25% risk of having a pup with LAD-III.</Text>

<GeneticsandInheritance>  
<Title>Genetics and Inheritance</Title>
<Text>The TYRP1 gene provides instructions for making enzyme called Tyrosinase-related protein. This enzyme is
located in melanocytes, which are specialized cells that give pigmentation to the coat. A homozygous
deletion CCT in TYRP1 gene results in an improper production of eumelanin leading to dilute brown coat
color. It should be noted that dog’s coat color is a polygenic condition and pigment inheritance is complex
and influenced by multiple genes.</Text>

              <ConditionAboutMain1>Vitamin A also known as Retinol is a fat soluble vitamin obtained from animal or plant sources. Human body cannot synthesize this vitamin. It is found in orange coloured fruits and vegetables, dark green leafy vegetables, organ meats, oily fish like Salmon, Tuna, Mackerel etc.</ConditionAboutMain1>
              <ConditionAboutMain2>
			  Vitamin A is vital for growth and development, cell integrity, vision, immune function, bone remodelling, cholesterol reduction and in the process of reproduction. Deficiency of Vitamin A is known to be associated with dry and bumpy skin, dry eyes, night blindness, risk for age related macular degeneration, infertility, stunted growth in children and throat and chest infections, hair loss and susceptibility for infections. Beta-carotene found in fruits and vegetables is the precursor of vitamin A. It is converted into Vitamin A in the liver and in a healthy adult. The circulating levels of beta carotene are modulated by fruit intake, sex and gene variants. Higher levels of Beta Carotene could lead to secondary Vitamin A deficiency.

              <ConditionAboutMain1>Vitamin D also known as ?Sun Shine Vitamin? is a fat soluble vitamin which is produced by human body in response to skin being exposed to sunlight. It is available in milk, fish, fish liver oil, egg yolks, strawberries, yeast, peanuts, beans, lentils etc. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption in the intestines, bone health, strength of teeth and muscle function. During the winter and rainty seasons, you need to get Vitamin D from your diet because the sun isn‘t strong enough for the body to make Vitamin D.</ConditionAboutMain1>
              <ConditionAboutMain2>
			  Deficiency of vitamin D is known to cause Rickets in children and Osteomalacia in adults. Vitamin D deficiency is incredibly common and most people are unaware of it. Decreased level of vitamin D is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairment in older adults, and severe asthma in children. Several large observational studies have shown a link between a Vitamin D deficiency and respiratory tract infections like colds, bronchitis and pneumonia. Genetic variants on genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, hydroxylation, and vitamin D transport affect vitamin D status and may raise risk of vitamin D insufficiency.

              <ConditionAboutMain1>Triglycerides are the most common type of fat (lipid) found in our body. Sources of fatty foods are butter, oils, cheese, red meat, baked food and ice cream. Our body converts extra calories, and extra alcohol into triglycerides and stores them in fat cells for future use. Excess triglycerides are stored along the arterial walls, which over a period of time can lead to hardening of the artery or arteriosclerosis. This, in turn, increases risk for stroke, heart attack and heart related ailments.</ConditionAboutMain1>

			  High triglycerides can also be a sign of Type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism) or rare genetic conditions and sometimes effect of certain medications that you may be taking. Excess drinking is one cause of high triglycerides. Avoiding sugar or refined carbohydrates, losing weight by regular exercise, limiting alcohol can help reduce your triglycerides. Genetic variations in certain genes are known to modulate the effect of fat intake on different health conditions.

It picks up Low Density Lipoproteins from the blood stream and takes them back to the liver, to be broken down and then excreted from your body. Lower amounts of HDL increase the risk of heart diseases, whereas healthy levels of HDL have been associated with protective function against stroke and heart attacks.</ConditionAboutMain1>
              <ConditionAboutMain2>
			  If your HDL levels are low, it is likely that LDL levels are high and your physician is likely to concentrate on reducing your LDL levels first than work on increasing HDL levels. It is still debated whether increasing HDL levels with medications confers the same protective function as higher HDL levels do naturally. Lifestyle changes such as moving more, quitting smoking or improving your diet that are known to increase HDL, have been shown to lower the risk of heart attack.

			  With a normal BMI, health advantages such as fewer joint and muscle pains, higher energy levels, better regulation of bodily fluids and blood pressure, reduction in burden on heart and circulatory system and relaxed sleep patterns are expected. Life style changes are advised in for high and low BMI individuals. Genetic variants in certain genes are known to modulate the effect of fat intake on BMI.

              <ConditionAboutMain1>Obesity is a complex health issue that is governed by genetics and behavior alike. There are multiple influences that lead to obesity such a dietary patterns, physical activity, use of certain medications etc. Obesity is diagnosed when an individual‘s BMI is above 30. As per recent estimates, more than 5% Indians are now obese and at risk for multiple diseases. Obesity is a serious health concern since it has now become one of the leading cause of death and reduces the overall quality of life. Being obese, increases your risk for many serious health issues that include, but are not limited to, High triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome — a combination of high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, heart diseases, stroke, many types of cancers, breathing disorders, including sleep apnea, gallbladder disease, gynecological problems, such as infertility and irregular periods, erectile dysfunction and sexual health issues, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis etc.</ConditionAboutMain1>

              <ConditionIconMain>D:/AnimalReport/carbs.GIF</ConditionIconMain>
              <ConditionAboutMain1>Carbohydrates are one of the most essential macronutrient in our diets, along with fat and proteins. However, carbohydrates also lead to weight gain. The two main forms of carbohydrates are sugars (such as fructose, glucose, and lactose) and starches (such as starchy vegetables, grains, rice, breads, and cereals). Food sources rich in carbohydrates are also rich in other nutrients such as vitamins, calcium, iron, starch and fibre are needed by the body. Long term starvation of the body of carbohydrates is likely to result in acute shortage of other vital nutrients in the body causing severe deficiencies.</ConditionAboutMain1>
              <ConditionAboutMain2>
			  In the case low glucose levels, the body can experience weakness, headaches, dizziness and irritability in the short term. So, a blanket ban on carbohydrate from your diet, is not only misaligned with your weight loss goals, but is also detrimental to your long term health prospects. Scientific research has found that certain individuals are more likely to gain weight when they consume carbohydrate in their diet. By knowing your genetic type, you can take informed decisions and balance your diet for health. Reasearch suggests significant gene-diet interaction and association between carbohydrate intake and wheight gain.
